# How to get going.

This project should work on Linux or MacOS. I used Ubuntu 20.04 and provide some notes here. Note, this is certainly not intended as a working guide to installing an OpenFlow controller in a real production environment. This is about how to investigate it as a hobby or because you are interested in networking. Floodlight is not the most well maintained controller out there, I use it because I'm familiar with it. Opendaylight is more modern but a little more effort to set up.

1. [Install floodlight](install_floodlight.md) 
2. [Install mininet](install_mininet.md)
3. Clone this repos
