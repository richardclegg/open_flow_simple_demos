## Installing Mininet

If you want to play with mininet separate to Floodlight then it is easy enough. On Ubuntu it is easy to configure this should be as simple as

    sudo apt install mininet

You can test it with:

    sudo mn

This should get you to a mininet prompt. You can test it with 

    h1 ping h2    

Ctrl-C will stop the ping. Ctrl-D will log you out.
